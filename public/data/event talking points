so we are currently just adding the events manually, and thats not bad
this allows us full control to what events get put where

1) google calendar
i was looking into google calendar, to see if we could just extract the calendar data from it, and throw it into our json format
this could still work

this would allow us to grab
title:
start:
end:
location:

we would have to grab the fields from the event's description area (or attachments but looking at api that may not be possible)
image:
description:
to:

we would still need a tool to scrape the sci calendar and and put the events in our format (maybe on our calendar?)

2) ms calendar?

same as google cal

3) the "manual way"

using google spreadsheets 

with spreadsheets we could share the spreadsheets with (anyone) and be able to control which events get published and which ones don't
this could also solve our fields problem, and spreadsheets should be fairly easily parsed to our json format

we could also pull the images and convert to webp (if we can't do that on release)

the other good part about this is that we would be able to scrape the calender using its rss feed
https://eventscalendar.umanitoba.ca/site/science/page/rss/?duration=30days

doing this we could use a (shocker) python script to be able to compile and push this to a file somewhere, we could also run this script once per day (idk like midnight) and check to see if there were changes (could see if we can see edit history using api)
this would also allow us to import the sci cal events but manually "audit" them to see which ones we truly want
(this would require work and the header image wouldn't work)

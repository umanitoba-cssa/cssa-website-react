Mia: You good to take this?

Isham: Oh yeah, yeah. So, um there's a random

poll on

Isham: To start off, I have a whole thing

written up, but does anyone have any

questions or does anyone remember seeing

this on their Discord feed?

Isham: that's just Minh stretching. Okay, um so yeah. So,



Essentially, what the referendum

was- Wait what? Oh, um, essentially so since I

guess joined University, I've always

wanted to do Computer Science, but uh

it's been a while for me I joined back

in 2018 and back then the program was

much smaller and there was like

different requirements for getting

Computer Science and one of those ones was taking

Calculus 1 (MATH 1500) and Calculus 2 (MATH 1700) hadn't been

added yet, but since I joined as it was

being added, it was a course that they

added later on, and recently I figured

out about myself that I was dealing

with some medical things and I was going

through some Bureaucracy with the

University to get those get

accommodations for those.
Isham: That was like an

almost three year long battle with the

University and eventually this summer,

I was going to be put on Academic

Suspension because of not being able to

complete some of those requirements and

I was going to be removed from CS

Isham: When I ran for the election

originally, it

was, it was like I ran as a CS student

so

um so being removed from CS

after being elected as a CS student, I

thought that wasn't-

Isham: I thought that wasn't transparent

enough so I chose to run this vote again

to confirm if this CS student body is

fine with me staying as CS president

without staying as a CS student, and I

did get options to get back into the

faculty

Isham: And because I took Calculus 1 (MATH 1500) so long

ago I wasn't able to, I'm not able to

take Calculus 2 again till from uh till

two years from now.
Isham: That means I would

get back into CS in three years, so that's

why this vote was held

and yeah

Isham: So, what this means essentially the

vote got veto'd but I realized it would

have been quite confusing based on the

the wording,

Isham: Yeah. um anyone have

questions?
Mark: Oh yeah, a point of

clarification vetoing this is coming

from uh like historical terms for votes

in Congress and whatnot but vetoing means

that the vote of non-confidence did not

pass or in plain words, that Isham is

still acting as President for the

remainder of the term.
Isham: Oh yeah, so I

guess I'll clarify there was a- this

was poorly run I agree and that was my

fault and one of those reasons was I was

also under time pressure because the

University just sent me a letter like

"Hey you have um they sent me on I think

September 7th that you will be removed

from the University by like the 17th or

something like that,

and me deciding to do this was more of

just transparency and

gaining insight on what the students

think and allowing me to I guess still

represent everyone in that

way.
Isham: So the results stayed and I took

into consideration people who did

message me like considerate for my

health and my own well-being for still

taking on this position, and I appreciate

that so I have a supportive team and I

think we can still continue to work for

students.
Lyle: yeah thank you Isham

for that, thank you for the update

but for the rest of the meeting we're

just going to tell you what we have

cooking for the rest of the year and for

next year, so we'd like to announce that

excitingly our constitution is now open

source! That's right! It is on GitHub I

believe um...I believe our GitHub is on

our LinkTree so you can look at it

right now. We are making a few changes

to our constitution we are bringing you

more positions. Let me tell you about them.

Lyle: We are going to be introducing three

new positions for the CSSA in the next

election. The first is going to be

Vice President which is like the

President but more of their assistant.

Lyle: If you like leadership roles but want

more experience before you transition

more into front-facing roles, if you

want to run for Vice President that

would be a great fit for you. We

are also having a separate

Director of Finance position for

everyone who likes to work with money.

Managing the finances and budgets for

people who are more detail oriented or

numbers

oriented, and our last new position we

are opening up to everyone will be

our Director of Promotions. This one's

going to be less commitment than most

of the others. It's mostly going to be

managing our social media, answering

our DMS, report with other groups,

coordinating work on the website, stuff

like that. So yeah, three new positions

one really fun one um so our

new constitution will make our

councillors-
Lyle: We will ratify the

councillors positions in our new

constitution once that gets voted in,

but we are, if you've noticed taking

councillor positions right now just

informally. So again, if you'd like to

apply for those councillor positions we

are still accepting applications and we

are still interviewing people. We

hope to be formally recognizing those

in our constitution coming next

year.
Mia: So, we've been talking about

councillors a little bit. You may have

seen the sign up form go up and a little

bit of talk about that.
Mia: If you're still

not quite sure what that is, a

councillor is basically a volunteer

position on the CSSA Council so you

can't like vote on, you know, the things

we decide on and stuff but you're very

welcome to attend our meetings, listen to

what we're saying and contribute your

own ideas, and also help us with like

General Club Affairs depending on

your interest areas.
Mia: So, this might

include helping us plan for or help

execute events, it could be making

posters or graphics it could be just

talking to people on Council and like

advocating a certain perspective, and

more!
Mia: It's a super flexible role, so you

can always ask about specific areas or

tasks you're interested in and also,

the time commitment is very flexible too,

so if you just want to see the inner

workings of student groups and maybe get

some experience in the CSSA maybe before

running for exec yourself (hint hint),

this is definitely an opportunity worth

checking out
Mia: Some of your expectations

would be helping with tasks as

necessary or as directed, attending

meetings for the CSSA like relevant to

your role and ongoing tasks.
Mia: You'd have

to be reachable by us through some

consistent form of communication.

Discord's kind of preferred, but if you

have something else in mind, we can try

to accommodate you, and the form for

signing up is already open.
Mia: It'll be

open year-round, so no rush if you're

busy right now or you only want to

start towards the end of the year.

Mia: There's no limit to how many councillors

we can take on, and there's no

requirements or prior experience needed.

Mia: On the logistics side, basically you

fill out the form. If your responses

intrigue us or we think we want to talk

to you a bit more, we'll call you in for

an interview which is really just

more like a 30 minute conversation so we

can get to know you a bit better and

hear about some of your goals or why

you're interested in this position, and

then we're going to start accepting

people to the team on kind of like, I

think bi-weekly basis, so the idea for

now, because we're still trying to get

our bearings on how to manage and

organize councillors.
Mia: We're going to start off

taking a small group of the people we've

interviewed so far, so if that's not you,

no worries!
Mia: We might reach out to you

later or add you to the team later. If

you've gone through this first batch of

interviews already, expect to hear

back from us sometime next week about

whether you can be added right away or

if we'll get back to you in the

future. Ethan also has a bit to add about

how it's going so far.
Ethan: Yeah,

Basically, so, if you guys, I know some

people are lounge supervisors, the

application for councillors is basically the

same.
Ethan: I did both. Essentially yeah,

we've had 30 people almost as of

yesterday apply. As for lounge supervisor

there've been 14, so if you guys are still

looking for to do something for sure

apply as well, like, on our side of things

is there anything like about the

applications or the process that you

guys have noticed or find

annoying

Ethan: It's okay if they have been they,

learning process for

everyone.

Ethan: Okay, so you already changed it?
Mia: It was on like

day one of applicationss being out, just change

one of the questions.

Ethan: Is there anything

else? no?
Ethan: Alright, that's basically it

for me then.
Mark: Noah, can you take it back one

slide...Thank you.
Mark: So, uh right now, I am

working somewhat independently but also

in collaboration with the department to

create a First Year Guide for students who

are joining into the program and one

of the things I want to do is not only

get the department's view on this, but

also student's views on this.
Mark: If you

have not yet joined the program of

Computer Science, that is you haven't

completed all your first year

requirements and applied to join in, I

want to hear from you your

experiences.
Mark: I'm especially interested

in your workload and how the courses

COMP 1000 and MATH 1240 being added

to the necessary pre-reqs to join the

program has affected you.
Mark: Even if

you're opinionated in any way, I just

want to hear as much different angles

from this.
Mark: Even if you're not in first

year, anyone can talk to me and then I'm

hoping to release this document by

kind of the end of the winter term so

that people joining in the fall of next

year (2024-25) High School Students now, they have

this document to guide themselves which

I think will be better than the document

in the U1 first year guide, which is not

controlled by the Department of Computer

Science or the Faculty of Science.

Mark: So we're kind of filling this niche and

I'm working on this along with some

other execs, so yeah if there's a

survey that I'm going to repost in the

Discord after this, but just reach

out to me too if you have any ideas,

anything like that, and we can use

this information and your experiences to

hopefully make a better experience for

people who come after you.

Mia: Sorry for jumping the gun. I got too

excited about councillors.

Ayesha: Well this, I had a segue from the

councillor thing, but speaking of

councillors, so some of you might

have heard of our Community Advocates

last general meeting or just as

announcements have gone on, and many

people have been, you know added to

those positions. Some of them are here

today if they want to stand up and

introduce

themselves.
Ayesha: I know it's very awkward

but I promise-
Mia: Come up here!
Ayesha: Yeah come up here!
Ethan: Come to the front!

Ayesha: No it's not

you.
Mia: So if you want to be in the

recording, the cameras are here, but if you don't,

then that's totally fine.

Emma: My name is Emma. I'm the Mature

Student

Advocate, so a mature student is

considered over 21 I believe, so if

that's you and have questions, I'm only a

first year student, so I don't have tons

of experience but starting school

late is a very different experience and

confusing and hard to navigate and all

those things. If you need any assistance

we can go through it

together.
Richard: My name is Richard and I'm the two

spirited

LGBTQ2SIA+
????: My name is ???? and I'm the racialized

student

advocate.
Ayesha: Yeah, so the the purpose of this

is sort of to introduce you to these

people and actually know what they look

like and because these positions

are meant to...This whole initiative is to

sort of create a more supportive and

inclusive environment

and to address issues that certain

groups face that like you know myself or

other execs might not be able to see,

and so if you ever have any questions or

anything, feel free to reach out to them.

Ayesha: I will be hopefully posting a thing

about that after this or myself

Ayesha: right now we are...this is a new

position and so a lot of it is both for

myself and also for all the

Advocates here.

Ayesha: We are brainstorming initiatives and

things like compiling

resources for different groups or

different things that students might

need, or creating little like

mentorship opportunities if you know

that might be something people are

interested in, so if you have any

suggestions or any feedback or any

complaints or whatever about your

experience, things you've been through,

even if you just want to commiserate,

all of us are happy to listen.
Ayesha: I

almost forgot to mention a couple people

are not here. we have Zara, she is our

Women's or Female Students Advocate,

Women's Advocate. I don't have a photo

for her I only have one for Pankaj, he's

the Disability Advocate, so you

know all of that's super cool! I hope you

guys talk to us after this.
Ayesha: A couple

more things. There are two positions

still unfilled so if this kind of

sounds interesting to you, if you have

opinions, if you want to help out, we

don't have an International Students Advocate,

and we don't have an Indigenous

Students, thank you Mia, Indigenous Students

Advocate. So, the application for

that is just the QR code here. You can

sign up, it's very similar to the

Councillor applications.
Ayesha: I don't have a

due date for that or anything, just you

know as they come. So, if you want to

do that, it's not a huge time commitment

a lot of what I was talking about right now

that's kind of the vibe there are some

meetings that different community

centers from UMSU put on that's once a

month, and then we'll have meetings

you know as a group, but other than

that, the time commitment is not huge.

Ayesha: If you have any questions about that

feel free to come ask me after.
(Hand goes up)
Ayesha: Oh yeah!

Awesome!
(Question Asked)
Ayesha: So the idea is to bring

your own unique perspective to not

just this team but the CSSA at large,

so you can bring up issues that maybe

you've experienced or other people you

know have experienced. It doesn't even

have to be just related to you know

whatever group you're representing.

Ayesha: The whole point is just to bring

different perspectives and hopefully

that will...we'll work together to

translate that into actual initiatives

that can help

people.
Ayesha: Kind of vague, but you know I

hope that answers your

question.

Ayesha: If there's nothing else I'll hand it

off.

(Clapping)

Mia: Okie dokie! So, we've been talking

about ways that you can start getting

involved with the CSSA, but maybe you're

already involved and you want to, I don't

know take it to the next level, so we're

going to be starting elections at the

beginning of next term. Not starting, but

like you should start thinking

about them pretty soon.
Mia: So yeah, if you

want to be part of the team, if you see

what we're doing and think you can do

better, then you know what I accept the

challenge, but yeah. Overall if you're

interested in one of these exact

positions and like these student groups

and organizational stuff, we highly

encourage people to think about running.

Mia: Our current plan is for the campaign

period to begin in February and to have

the results by March, that way you don't

have to be worrying about elections at

the same time as finals or any like

final projects and whatnot for your

courses.
Mia: So the plan is for nominations

to open February 5th and run till

February 12th.
Mia: We do self nomination

generally so you just declare who you

are position you want to run for and

nothing else because that's pre-

campaigning and that's not allowed!

Mia: Campaigning would open February 13th and

run through the 25th so you get two

weeks to campaign. You can talk about

your platform to others, publish any like

graphics or campaign materials if you're

interested in that.
Mia: Usually during this

time we'll also have a meeting, so that's

like a Q&A kind of panel with the

candidates, and we'll have some dedicated

questions but also

that's your chance to ask them about

their platform or who they are or what

their goals are for the CSSA and the

elections themselves are going to be

February 26th to March 1st, so there

will be a week where the election form

is open. Again, you are expected to not campaign

during this time and at the end of that,

we'll tally up the results and the

incoming exec team is going to work with

us during a little transition period, so

they can shadow us, see kind of how we do

things, get a feel for what the role

means, and we'll also giving them some

materials and a transition guide to help

them get started.
Mia: We'll release more

timelines and information as they get

decided including the available

positions which I'm going to get to in

the next slide.
Mia: Yeah actually we can

flip that now. So these are the positions

we have right now. So as you can see we

have President, Director of Advocacy,

Events, Internal Affairs, Lounge Affairs, and

Student Affairs, but depending on if we're able

to get our constitution UMSU-approved

and voted in before then, we would also

be adding those three positions that

Lyle introduced; Vice President,

Director of Promotions, and Director of

Finances.
Mia: So, prepare to run for one of

these if you're interested, but you may

also have the chance to run for one of

those three.
Mia: If you're considering

running for Finance, you might consider

running for Internal and Finance. If

you're considering running for

Promotions, you might consider running

for Events if that's not available, and

if you're interested in Vice President,

you can always, you know, like jump the

gun a little and go right for President

or you could try for Internal and

Finances.
Mia: So again, those are your options

if our constitution isn't updated with

the new positions in time. Generally,

as an executive, you're expected to

attend and organize meetings.
Mia: You also

are expected to send a representative to

department meeting, so the Department of

Computer Science. You're able to take

notes and find out what's happening

among the Faculty...as well, it's

important to have a relationship with

UMSU and the Science Students

Association (SSA) who so kindly let us

use their lounge for this meeting

Mia: and generally represent, advocate for,

and bring together Computer Science

students in our community, so if that

sounds like something you're interested

in, we highly encourage you to keep your

eye out for more information about our

elections.
Mia: As for some smaller things,

you may have heard these things kind of

going around. Here's a reminder of some

of our ongoing projects and upcoming

stuff to get excited for!
Mia: So, if you've

heard about the industrial project

course (COMP 4560), I believe the code is

COMP 4560, that is basically

Mark: Can I jump it?
Mia: of course you can! yeah!

Mark: All right. (Clears throat) If you are in third or fourth

year and you have taken COMP

3350, and you are not in the coop

program and you want an easy, no waitlist

fourth year credit, three credit

hour course, go talk to Rob by next

Wednesday.
Mark: Tuesday I think is better, but

I think he can squeak you in if it's

Wednesday.
Mark: There are lots of great

industry-related projects that will give

you real work experience, and it's where

all you do is, you can come with your

own group, choose your own group, go there

knock it out, you get three credit hours

fourth year credit, use that to finish

your degree. It's a great opportunity.

Mark: This is for Winter, 2023 I.E
Mia: 2024!

Mark: I.E....like in four weeks y,ou can get a

course if you're looking to fill out

your semester and you need a course, that is

something you can do.
Mark: Go talk to Rob

or there's a folder in the CSSA Lounge

with all of the projects and papers you

can like look through that. They're

also posted on the wall.
Mark: It's a great

opportunity if you're not in Co-op to

get work experience.
Mia: So that's Rob Guderian

I believe his email is what Rob

Guderian?
Mark: robert.guderian@umanitoba.ca
Mia: There you go, and

again yeah, you might have class with him,

you might know where his office is, he's

THE contact for this type of thing. We

also- Yes?
Attendee: What's his office
Mia: It's

Mia: 40- (E2-405 EITC)
Isham: It's in that hallway.
Mark: It's got his name on

it
Mia: I always forget because it was a

bonus question one of our test ones

actually-
Mark: Although okay, I would not, he's

not always in the office. I would send

him an an email first, and that way

you could guarantee to get into a spot.

Mark: He's looking for people there are 40

extra slots open. 40

slots.
Mia: As long as you have taken Software

Engineering (COMP 3350) and are not in

Co-op, this is for you.
Mia: alright, there's

also instructor interviews that are

still going on. I know Mark and Isham

have both been involved in that. If

you like to speak on it you might know

the details better than I do.
Mark: Yeah I-

I can want okay. More or less, the

department is letting us sit in with-

Mark: They're hiring new people as instructors,

so we're sitting in as Student

Representatives, and then we basically

just get to hear their outlook

on how they want to teach and what they

see for the future of the department.

Mark: Yeah.
Mia: When are the next interview dates?

do you know?

Mark: it's Wednesday and a

Friday
Mark: It's in the Discord. I think it's

the....I don't know the dates off the top my

head. The last one is December 6
Mia: I

knew that one too, memorable

date.
Mia: Okay, there's also a Secret Santa

that we're organizing. Isham is doing

that through Elfster. There is a sign

up link in Discord. We can repost it

later if you'd like, but that's a fun way

to get to know some of your Computer

Science friends and also share some

holiday spirit, and we're bringing back

hoodie sales! We're working on another

round of-
Mia: Thank you! Another round of

Hoodie orders potentially some different

colors and different logo placements.

Mia: Stay tuned if you miss the first one or

if you just want another way to rep CSSA

in public so everyone knows how cool you

are, but thank you!
Mia: That about does it so

Isham: I'm gonna add the if you want to join

the Secret Santa, the deadline is tonight

so...

Isham: You can join tonight so that way

people have time to order

gifts.
Isham: They'll be coming on time.
Mia: Okay so,

now, let's open the

floor!
Mia: Anybody have questions about what

we talked about today or just comments,

ideas.
Mark: I don't have a question. I'll just

briefly someone asked this question in

the form to see what kind of pizza they

wanted. No no! This was completely fine,

someone ask what we do on behalf of the

CS students um...
Mark: I'll be pretty frank. So,

the Department in some cases, we

directly talk. We talk to David who is

the Head of the Department, we talked to

Zach, Braico, um....
Mia: Full names please! Full names please!

Mark: I don't know their full names

Mia: David Gerhart, John Braico, Michael Zapp, Franklin

Bristo.
Mark: Yeah, we talked to them. They

are respectively Head of

Undergraduate, Head of Undergraduate

Experience, and Franklin will be

subbing into to Zapp and John

Mark: Oh yeah,

first name basis, he's gonna be subbing in for Zapp

and John for those two roles as they go

on sabatical for the next I believe year.

Mark: So we involve him too. So we

talk about these issues, we bring these

issues up. Ultimately, it's the

Department's decision.
Mark: We do have two

voting...votes in anything brought up

into the Department Meetings, so that

means any kind of any department

meetings, we have two votes every faculty

member or every Department member has a

vote in there.
Mark: Beyond that, our

largely, our impact is somewhat

stunned. We cannot go in there and say

"WE VETO THIS!1!"
Mark: We do not have that power

as an organization. It's mostly we

come to them and say these are the

problems we're experiencing, and I think

you do have to...from my experience, the

department has a lot of Goodwill.

Mark: They are not trying to screw over students.

They have their hands tied in a lot of

ways and they're doing the best they can

within those confines, so while it can

be frustrating on our side, I can guarantee

that they're frustrated on their side

too.
Mark: They want to fix all of the

problems that you're experiencing and

we're trying, we're working with

them to fix these problems, but this is a

long process that has to go through

layers and layers of Bureaucracy like anything else

in the

University.
Mia: And you can feel free to get

in contact with us at any time. You

can DM one of us on Discord.
Mia: We also have

our email, our Instagram, if you want to

bring your concerns to us and before we

end off, we have a little announcement

from Women in Computer Science (WICS) as well

so I'm going to let Fatima, their events coordinator,

take the floor just briefly before we

end off.
(Applause)

Fatima: So, we're going to be having an event

next week on Thursday it's called How

and Why to be an Ally.

Fatima: I really recommend you all come because

it's going to be really nice to just

have that

conversation. We're going to be having

uh a few people from the industry and

some people from our faculty beyond

the panel to speak, so, yeah-
Mia: Are you

allowed to say who's going to speak?

Fatima: Yeah um so it's going to be Andrew

Stevens from Payworks so he's the

Vice President of-

Fatima: Yeah, Vice President at Payworks and (inaudible)

She's a student, Grad

Student here, and then

Cody, Cody

Mia: Cody Wallbridge
Mark: The loud one!



Mark: The older one, the construction worker
Fatima: Yeah, and

then there will be Kimo

from..
Mia: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
Fatima: Yeah, thank you! I'm sorry I

don't have a poster I swear I have it

but I just don't have it on my phone.

Fatima: Yeah, do come! There's going to be food

provided by the Computer Science

Department so fancy food, not chips and-

Mia: Hey, WOAH, WOAH!



Fatima: So, yeah

Ethan: What time and where is it?

Fatmina: There's going to be two sessions. One

is 214 Russell.
Fatima: I will make sure to make

more like an actual detailed

announcement with all these things, like

posters on Discord, and then I'll send it

to our Instagram too.
Fatima: So and then the

second session so first session at 10 AM

November 30th next Thursday

214 Russell Building

Fatima: Don't know why

There is like a message me like,

I can make a thing where we all meet and

then we go together, and then the second

session is actually in Engineering

Building 320, I believe E2-320

EITC at 2:30 p.m.
Fatima: If you have a class

Fatima: So please do come though

Yeah!

Matt: Which day was the second session?
Fatima: It's the same day.

Yeah

(Inaudible)

Fatima: The panelists will be

attending both SE sessions, so if you

want to get a chance to you know, meet

them and like talk to

them

Fatima: When will you ever get the chance to

like talk to the Vice President of Payworks

about Gender Diversity?

Fatima: So, do come!





Mia: Yeah, we get a lot of questions from

people saying like, we know, we know that

there's a lack of diversity in Computer

Science but like what can we do about it?

Mia: This is what you can do about it, so, if

you've ever wondered like how you

support Gender Minorities and other

kinds of Minorities in the field, we

highly encourage you to check out some

of WICS' other events and

initiatives.
Mia: That's all from us though.

Mia: Thanks so much for coming out! Have a

great weekend have a great rest of your

night, even though it's like six o'clock.

Mia: Look how dark it is!

Ethan: I play hide and

seek
Mia: yeah thank you so much!

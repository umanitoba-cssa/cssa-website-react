MIA: Ok, we all good?
Thanks everyone for coming out!
It's really great. We were expecting, like, two people to show up,
so this is really nice.
So, we have pizza on the way,
as soon as that comes, feel free to--
we'll probably break the meeting, I don't know,
you can get up and grab some pizza if you're hungry.
Next slide please.

Oh, yeah, I do want to say before we get started,
we are streaming this,
and we're also going to record it
and hopefully archive it on our website after the meeting.
So if you chime in or get in the audio,
just let us know if you don't want to be in it,
we can cut your part out, but it shouldn't be that big of a deal.
Anyway, so we'll start off with a quick introduction with
who we are as a student group,
and who we have on Council this year.
If you didn't get the chance to spend time with us this summer,
we'll also recap some of what we had going on
and what we have still going on in the month of August.
We've already got some exciting plans for the rest of the term,
so stay tuned to hear more about what we have in mind for you.
And then, probably the most important topic we have today
is that we want to revamp our constitution
to better serve computer science students,
because we are one of the biggest and most diverse
and fastest-growing communities on campus.
Nothing we bring up in this section is final,
we're still discussing ideas and would love to get your feedback
on the directions that we're headed so far.
Next slide.

LYLE: There we go.

AYESHA: First of all, for anyone who doesn't know,
what even is the CSSA?
We're the official for computer science students here at the U of M
to support computer science students in their undergraduate degrees, basically.
We work to maintain a friendly, welcoming, and supportive environment
and we voice your concerns
and relay your perspectives
to the Department of Computer Science and the wider Faculty.
As Mia mentioned, we aim to help
all of you computer science students
in any way we can,
whether through advice with courses,
or navigating through the co-op program, which is notoriously difficult,
all of those things.
Alright!

MIA: So, should we go in order, or just...

MARK: Down the couch. Start with Ayesha, and then...

MIA: Couch order?

MARK: Couch order.

AYESHA: Ok, yeah!
First is me, Ayesha.
I'm the Director of Advocacy.
We'll explain what that means later.

ISHAM: I'm Isham, I'm a Co-president.

MIA: I'm Mia, I'm the other Co-president.

MARK: Mark, Student Affairs.

ETHAN: I'm Ethan, I'm Lounge Affairs.

NOAH: I'm Noah, Director of Events.

LYLE: And me, not facing you guys,
I'm Lyle, I'm Director Internal.

MIA: Ok!
So, we had a lot of fun this summer!
Huge thank you to everybody who made it out to our barbecue in July.
We were really happy to see some new faces
and it's a miracle that the weather worked out so nicely.
For those of you who couldn't make it,
we'll have more ways to meet and mingle with your classmates and professors,
so you can look forward to that.
We also redid our website!
It lists some more information about us,
shows off the events we've got coming up,
and it has helpful links and lecture videos
as well as a feedback form for you to tell us
your concerns, ideas, and suggestions,
both about the website, and then just about
the lounge, the CSSA more generally,
so the URL for that is umanitobacssa.ca.
Probably should have linked it, but
you can find it later. It's not too hard to find.
And speaking of events we've got coming up,
we've been doing movie nights all summer long,
and the next one is right after this!
So we hope you can stay and enjoy the show.
That'll be Mark heading that up.
I'm sure he'll talk to you about it later.
And, next slide.

NOAH: Alright, so looking further ahead,
we're going to be kicking off the year with
a back-to-back set of events:
a mixer and a Capture the Flag competition.
If you've never participated in one before, basically,
a Capture the Flag is a type of security competition
where your goal is to solve programming and security challenges
and earn as many points as you can within the time limit.
This is going to be an all-day, in-person,
team-oriented event, and we plan to have lots of prizes
so I do recommend that you give it a shot if you can.
Now, we know this is going to be held at the start of the year,
and people will still be settling into their classes
and making new friends,
especially students in first year.
So to help get to know each other
and form teams for the event,
we're going to also be holding a mixer
the Friday evening before the competition.
We're going to have snacks,
and you can come socialize and make more friends.
We're currently expecting to hold the CTF around a month into Fall term,
so follow our Discord and our Instagram
for the date when we pick it
and any other details as we share them.
Next slide.

MARK: Ok, so,
right now,
we are revamping our constitution.
So, why we are doing that is because
last year, the CSSA basically went--
the sunset clause of our whole constitution came into effect
because there was not an Annual General Meeting held for a full year.
So now, that meant that
we now aren't officially recognized
by UMSU.
So what we have done already this year--already done--
is we have submitted a
preliminary constitution to UMSU.
So that is done; that is out of the way.
But what we are working on now is
coming up with amendments to that constitution,
and then we are going to submit that--
I think the pizza's here, almost--
so, we're going to [make those] amendments to the constitution,
and have that new constitution ready
for our official Fall Annual General Meeting
in the first three weeks of September, something like that.
I think the 18th.
I've been known to have off-by-one errors on my dates.
[laughs]
So, yeah. We're going to show you a bunch of new changes,
these are not changes that are in our current proposed constitution
that has already been submitted to UMSU,
these are going to be constitution changes
to our upcoming constitution
which you, the people, can vote on in September.
Sure, go to the next slide.

Our first thing, actually another little thing,
like, why bother?
Right? Like, why be recognized by UMSU?
Why do we care?
More or less, it gives us more access to funding,
resources by UMSU,
room bookings, equipment, like this room, this equipment,
things like that.
And it also guarantees some stability for the CSSA
in the following years.
Another thing that we're changing in the upcoming constitution
is that we are going to be changing when the CSSA elections happen.
So, last term, they happened
during finals week. That's not going to happen this term.
We're going to be pushing that back
at least a month, officially,
we're going to put that in the constitution,
most likely it's going to be, like, a month and a half.
I got here: I think it's going to be mid...
Election period will finish mid-March, most likely;
the election process will happen in the middle of February.
So if you're interested in participating in that,
that is the timeline
that you're working with.
And there's some new people here, which is exciting,
and if you want to run for CSSA, like,
just do it, man, it's
not-- not too hard.
[laughter]
So yeah.
That's more or less the thing.
So the big thing with this is, officially,
there's going to be some smaller details,
and I said we're going to release this new constitution
at the beginning of September
you're going to have three weeks to review it,
and then you're going to vote on it during that meeting.
So if you want to, look at the nitty-gritty, but the TL;DR is
three weeks before the end of the Winter term
is when we will hold our election.
Next slide.

NOAH: Alright, so like Mark said,
it's never too early to consider running for exec,
especially since we're going to be pitching three new positions here today.
So note that, first of all,
these aren't in our constitution yet; we're still
drafting it up and thinking about it to eventually vote on it,
but if we do decide to add them to our constitution,
these new positions won't be filled
until the next election cycle.
So they're going unfilled this year, and then they'll get filled for next year.
Also, the time estimates that we're showing here, they're pretty liberal.
The upper bounds are just to give you an idea
of how much that you may be putting in every now and then,
just so you can make sure that you can actually fit these positions
into your schedule if you decide to run.
So, the first new role is the Vice President role.
So while the President is a pretty forward-facing role,
and they still end up being the primary liaison
to other clubs, the Department, and beyond,
the Vice President might take on more behind-the-scenes tasks:
so overseeing day-to-day operations,
or touching base with individual Council members.
Of course, the two roles will probably share a lot of duties,
a big part is that Vice President is expected
to take on the President's job in their absence.
So if you are looking to try out a leadership role
but you're worried about-- maybe you lack some experience,
Vice President may be a good fit for you.
We also want to propose a Director of Finances role
specifically for managing CSSA spending and accounts.
This used to be part of the Director of Internal Affairs role,
but it's kind of a big undertaking,
and we think it deserves its own dedicated position on Council.
The role would work with the Director of Lounge Affairs
to manage supplies' costs, and
and also work with the Director of Events to plan event budgets.
And more broadly, you'll also be working with banks
and potential sponsors for our events.
You might also notice the wildly varying time commitment here:
the position would likely be a lot more active
during event planning and execution,
and then the amount of time that you have to commit
will die down a little bit when there's no major events in planning.
Next slide.

MIA: Ok.
So we said we're pitching three positions;
there are four. We are only pitching three.
Director of Advocacy is actually one of the roles
that's already in our constitution.
You may have noticed that that's the role Ayesha is filling.
So, that's something we recently added
to formally include the Women in Computer Science,
or WICS, Interclub Liaison
into our voting members.
However, being a voting member of two student groups is--
it's a lot of work.
So in the future, we want to include it as
an elected position on its own.
This role focuses on advocating for
marginalized groups in computer science,
giving students who feel underrepresented
a dedicated voice on the CSSA Council.
This role might work more closely with other student groups,
like WICS, and WICS' own Interclub Liaison
to help their members feel included
in the wider computer science community.
Also, our pizza just got here,
so if you'd like to take a quick break,
get up and grab some pieces--
What do we have? We have...
What kind of pizzas do we have?

ISHAM: We have Hawaiian, pepperoni,
veggie, cheese, barbecue chicken,
I think that's it.

MIA: That's it.

ISHAM: And there's a "wild card."
I forgot which one that was.

MIA: Ok, perfect! So yeah,
you can feel free to get up and
grab some, I'll wait until people start settling down
and then we'll get into the rest of it.
MIA: Ok, cool! So while you guys eat your pizza,
I'm going to continue talking about
our other role that we're going to pitch.
So last but not least,
we are thinking of adding a Director of Promotions role
for managing our website and social media pages.
This role would work closely with the Director of Events
to help make graphics, posters,
or messages advertising the CSSA's activities
throughout the year.
They'd also monitor our social media pages,
keep the website up-to-date,
and pass on word about our activities to the Department,
along with anything they think could help us reach more people.
This would hypothetically be more of an entry-level position;
the base time commitment is for
passively monitoring social media and website maintenance,
and then it would also take on a more active role
when events are happening. As we'll get into on the next slide, though,
we are still discussing amongst ourselves
whether we want to take this approach to promotions, or something else.

AYESHA: I'll get into that in a second.
But the big thing is,
we are announcing a new way to get involved:
Councillors and committees.
So these would be positions where you would
volunteer for certain events or different duties
I'll explain in a second.
This would be a--
We intend to have a year-round application,
like a form, for the Councillor position--
which is non-voting, by the way.
Part of what you do as a Councillor is
join committees that we make throughout the year,
perhaps to organize a certain event,
supervise the lounge, or
help with the website, promotion...
We're thinking of having a Councillor application form
on the website where you can
sign up for active committees,
or if there aren't any, you can just
sign up as a sort of "floating volunteer"
and talk about what you are willing to volunteer for,
any duties you'd like to have.
One thing, as Mia mentioned, we're discussing is
whether or not promotions should be handled
by their own Director, or by a committee.
Having a committee for promotions would allow for
more Councillors to try out the position,
which would be cool, but there's a lot of things
within that position that might be
more easily done by one single person
just leading it on their own.
If you have any opinions, this is where you'd use the
feedback form: we'd love to hear-- or just talk to us after;
we'd love to hear what you have to say.
Another thing:
Under the Director of Advocacy,
we want to have Community Advocates.
These would also essentially just be Councillors,
but Community Advocates specifically--
there are five roles
that correspond to the UMSU-recognized communities.
So: Women; the 2SLGBTQIA+ community;
BIPOC students, people of colour,
specifically Black, Indigenous, and Racialized Advocates;
students with disabilities;
international; and then mature students.
So we would ideally have a position for each of these communities,
and if you belong to them, you could
bring yourself on, and say,
"Hey, I want to advocate for my community in this way,"
and they would all answer to the Director of Advocacy.
It's a really nice way to get involved, and
it's just cool. I'm really excited about this!
[laughs] Anyway,
Community Advocates would be free to
with any other Councillor duties;
you're not limited to one single thing,
but they have the extra expectation of, again,
working with the Director of Advocacy
and other executives, where applicable,
to make sure marginalized students' voices are heard.
As Mia mentioned,
we're one of the largest-growing communities,
and I think keeping that community inclusive and progressive
is very important.

ISHAM: Ok, so definitely a lot of information,
so reach out to us on our website or social media
if you have any questions, concerns, or ideas later on.
But if anybody has something they'd like to contribute right now,
we'd love for you to share.

MIA: Ok, so that's all for today
thanks again everyone for coming by,
we really hope to see you again in the lounge,
in class, or at our other events,
like the movie night that's happening in T-25 minutes!
Have a great evening,
feel free to grab some more pizza on your way out, if you'd like,
you can also stay and mingle.
We're going to cut off the recording now, so
all hell can break loose and whatnot, but...
Thanks so much!

LYLE: Thank you, everyone!
